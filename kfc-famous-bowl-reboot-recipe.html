    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      The KFC Famous Bowl is comfort stacked in a single vessel. I first had one during finals week, sitting cross-legged on the dorm floor, surrounded by notebooks, caffeine, and existential dread. It was warm, messy, and tasted like survival. Like a hug from someone who doesn’t ask questions.

      But the fast-food version started to feel flat. Too salty, not enough soul. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to layer it with intention. To build a bowl that stacks comfort, chaos, and flavor like it’s going on stage.

      This version starts with creamy mashed potatoes, topped with crispy popcorn chicken, sweet corn, shredded cheese, and a peppery gravy that knows how to make an entrance. It’s not just a bowl—it’s a mood. A meltdown in five layers.

      I’ve served it at movie marathons, post-party recoveries, and rainy day rituals. I’ve swapped chicken for mushrooms, added jalapeños, and even turned it into a brunch bake. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than KFC.”

      So here it is. Layered Like a Legend. A Famous Bowl reboot that stacks comfort and chaos. Spoon it hot. Eat it proud. And don’t forget the nap—this bowl earns it.
