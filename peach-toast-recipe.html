      <h2>🕯️ The Ritual</h2>
      <p>
        I made this toast the morning after my grandmother passed. The peaches were overripe, the bread was thick, and the honey was the kind she used to stir into her tea. I didn’t plan it—it just happened. And somehow, it felt like she was there.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn’t just breakfast. It’s a ritual of remembrance. A way to start the day with softness and sweetness. A way to say: I’m still here, and so are you.
