    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      The caramel frappuccino is a mood. I first had one before a summer road trip, glitter still stuck to my cheek from the night before, playlist queued, and zero sleep. It was cold, sweet, and tasted like rebellion. Like skipping class. Like dancing in a parking lot at sunrise.

      But the drive-thru version started to feel flat. Too sweet, not enough vibe. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to elevate. To remix. To serve up the chill with flavor that slaps and texture that hits.

      This version blends cold brew, oat milk, caramel syrup, and ice until smooth and frosty. Then it’s topped with whipped cream, a caramel drizzle, and a sprinkle of sea salt if you’re feeling chaotic. It’s not just a drink—it’s a flex. A glitter bomb in a cup.

      I’ve served it at brunches, beach hangs, and post-yoga snack attacks. I’ve added espresso shots, swapped syrups, and even frozen it into popsicles. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Starbucks.”

      So here it is. Blended Bliss. A caramel frappuccino reboot that outshines the drive-thru. Sip it slow. Snap it fast. And don’t forget the whipped cream—it’s non-negotiable.
