    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      The Big Mac isn’t just a burger—it’s a cultural artifact. I first had one at a mall food court, wearing jelly bracelets and sneaking fries between shifts at Hot Topic. Two patties, three buns, pickles, lettuce, and that sauce. It was messy, iconic, and weirdly comforting. Like a hug from someone who still listens to pop-punk.

      Years later, I craved that same chaos—but with better ingredients and way more flair. I wanted the Big Mac, but I wanted it on my terms. Toasted buns, juicy patties, and a sauce that slaps harder than nostalgia. I wanted a burger that could headline a brunch or shut down a rooftop party.

      So I built this copycat. It’s got the layers, the crunch, the sauce—but it’s elevated. The patties are seasoned with garlic and onion powder. The buns are buttered and toasted. The sauce? Mayo, ketchup, relish, mustard, vinegar, paprika, and attitude. It’s not just a copy—it’s a remix.

      I’ve served it at backyard hangs, festival pre-games, and chaotic kitchen dance parties. I’ve stacked it with jalapeños, swapped the middle bun for hash browns, and even turned it into sliders. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than the original.”

      So here it is. The Big Mac, TastefulEats.store style. Stacked, sauced, and ready to flex. Serve it loud. Eat it proud. And don’t forget the playlist—this burger deserves a soundtrack.
