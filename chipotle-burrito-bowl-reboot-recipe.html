    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      The Chipotle burrito bowl was my gateway to edible independence. I remember customizing my first one like it was a mixtape—extra rice, double beans, no judgment. It was layered, loud, and felt like a personal anthem in a compostable container.

      But the chain version started to feel predictable. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to remix. To build a bowl that layers heat, crunch, and hype like it’s headlining a flavor festival.

      This version starts with cilantro-lime rice, smoky black beans, and grilled chicken or mushrooms. Then comes the corn salsa, spicy pico, shredded cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. Top it with crushed tortilla chips and a drizzle of chipotle crema. It’s not just a bowl—it’s a build-your-own legend.

      I’ve served it at rooftop hangs, post-gym snack attacks, and chaotic kitchen dance parties. I’ve swapped proteins, added guac, and even turned it into nachos. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Chipotle.”

      So here it is. Built to Bowl. A burrito bowl reboot that layers heat, crunch, and hype. Stack it proud. Stir it loud. And don’t forget the chips—they’re part of the plot twist.
