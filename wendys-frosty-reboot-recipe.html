    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      The Wendy’s Frosty was my first taste of dessert rebellion. I remember dipping fries into it at a drive-thru parking lot, windows down, music loud, rules forgotten. It was cold, sweet, and slightly unhinged. Like soft serve with a punk playlist.

      But the fast-food version started to feel tame. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to defy. To build a Frosty that dips fries, breaks rules, and melts hearts.

      This version blends chocolate ice cream, whipped topping, and condensed milk until it’s thick enough to hold a fry and smooth enough to seduce a spoon. It’s not just dessert—it’s a dare. You can freeze it firmer or slurp it softer. You can add espresso, peanut butter, or glitter. I won’t stop you.

      I’ve served it at rooftop hangs, post-rant snack attacks, and chaotic midnight cravings. I’ve poured it into cones, layered it into parfaits, and even turned it into milkshake shots. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Wendy’s.”

      So here it is. Cold, Sweet, Defiant. A Frosty reboot that dips fries and breaks rules. Serve it chilled. Eat it loud. And don’t forget the fries—they’re part of the ritual.
