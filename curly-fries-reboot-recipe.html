    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Arby’s curly fries were my first taste of snack rebellion. I remember grabbing a tray after a thrift haul, spirals stacked like golden chaos, dipping sauces lined up like mood swings. They were crispy, seasoned, and unapologetically twisted.

      But the fast-food version started to feel predictable. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to spiral out. To build curly fries that crunch louder, twist harder, and snack smarter.

      This version starts with russet potatoes spiral-cut (mandoline or spiralizer, your call), soaked to remove starch, then tossed in a seasoned flour blend and fried until golden. The seasoning? Paprika, garlic, onion, cayenne, and a whisper of sugar. It’s not just fries—it’s a snack riot.

      I’ve served them at rooftop hangs, post-rant snack attacks, and chaotic brunch spreads. I’ve dipped them in spicy mayo, cheese sauce, and even caramel (don’t judge). Every time, they hit. Every time, someone says, “These are better than Arby’s.”

      So here it is. Twisted, Crispy, Unruly. A curly fries reboot that spirals into snack chaos. Serve them hot. Dip them proud. And don’t forget the napkins—these fries come with drama.
