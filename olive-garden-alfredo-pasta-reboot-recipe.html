    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Olive Garden’s Alfredo was my first taste of edible romance. I remember twirling fettuccine on a first date, nervous laughter echoing off fake Tuscan walls, sauce clinging to noodles like a love letter. It was rich, dramatic, and slightly over-the-top—just like the moment.

      But the chain version started to feel heavy without heart. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to seduce. To build an Alfredo that stuns with flavor, clings with intention, and leaves you breathless by the last bite.

      This version starts with butter, garlic, and cream—slow-simmered until silky. Then comes the parmesan, melting into a sauce that coats every noodle like it means it. I use fresh fettuccine, but you can swap in linguine, rigatoni, or even gnocchi if you’re feeling chaotic.

      I’ve served it at candlelit dinners, rooftop brunches, and post-breakup healing feasts. I’ve added mushrooms, grilled chicken, and even lobster. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Olive Garden.”

      So here it is. Creamy, Clingy, Iconic. An Alfredo reboot that seduces and stuns. Serve it hot. Twirl it slow. And don’t forget the wine—this pasta deserves a toast.
