    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Crazy Bread was my first taste of snack anarchy. I remember tearing into a bag after a thrift haul, garlic butter dripping, parmesan snowing, marinara steaming like drama. It was soft, salty, and slightly unhinged. Like breadsticks with a personality disorder.

      But the chain version started to feel limp. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to unleash. To build bread that’s pillowy, chaotic, and engineered to scream for sauce.

      This version starts with a soft, enriched dough brushed with garlic butter and showered in parmesan. Baked until golden, then served with a side of spicy marinara or ranch. It’s not just bread—it’s a snack tantrum.

      I’ve served it at rooftop hangs, post-rant snack attacks, and chaotic brunch spreads. I’ve stuffed it with cheese, twisted it into knots, and even turned it into garlic bread tacos. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Little Caesars.”

      So here it is. Soft, But Make It Chaotic. A Crazy Bread reboot that screams for sauce. Serve it hot. Dip it proud. And don’t forget the napkins—this bread gets emotional.
