    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      The Crunchwrap Supreme is a structural masterpiece. I first had one in the backseat of a car after a concert, glitter on my cheeks, bass still ringing in my ears. It was warm, crispy, and somehow held together like a flavor origami. I didn’t speak—I just crunched.

      That moment became a craving. Not just for the taste, but for the drama. The fold. The chaos. So I made my own. Not to copy Taco Bell—but to remix it. To build a Crunchwrap that breaks the rules and the internet.

      This version starts with a giant flour tortilla, layered with seasoned beef (or plant-based swap), nacho cheese, a crispy tostada shell, sour cream, lettuce, tomatoes, and shredded cheese. Then it’s folded into a hexagon and pan-seared until golden. It’s not just a wrap—it’s a flex.

      I’ve served it at brunches, beach hangs, and post-show snack attacks. I’ve stuffed it with jalapeños, swapped beef for mushrooms, and even added hot Cheetos. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Taco Bell.”

      So here it is. Crunchwrap Chaos. A reboot that folds flavor, flexes structure, and delivers drama. Serve it hot. Snap it fast. And don’t forget the drip—it’s part of the performance.
