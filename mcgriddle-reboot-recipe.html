    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      The McGriddle is chaos in sandwich form. I first had one on a road trip at 6AM, glitter still stuck to my cheek, half-asleep and fully starving. It was sweet, salty, sticky, and somehow perfect. Like breakfast and dessert had a messy love child.

      But the drive-thru version started to feel flat. Too processed, not enough vibe. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to unleash it. To build a McGriddle that slaps harder, drips louder, and feeds the brunch rebellion.

      This version starts with maple pancake buns—yes, buns made of pancakes. Then comes the sausage patty, crispy bacon, and a fried egg with a yolk that knows how to run. It’s stacked, sticky, and unapologetically indulgent. You can add cheese, hot sauce, or glitter if you’re feeling bold.

      I’ve served it at rooftop brunches, post-rave breakfasts, and chaotic kitchen dance parties. I’ve swapped sausage for mushrooms, added jalapeños, and even turned it into sliders. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than McDonald’s.”

      So here it is. Sweet, Savory, Unhinged. A McGriddle remix for brunch rebels. Stack it high. Drip it proud. And don’t forget the napkins—you’ll need them.
