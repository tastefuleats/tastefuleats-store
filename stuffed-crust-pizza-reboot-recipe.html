    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Stuffed crust pizza is drama. I first had it at a sleepover in middle school, surrounded by soda cans, glitter nail polish, and a stack of rom-com DVDs. Someone pulled a slice and the cheese stretched like a slow-motion moment in a teen movie. We screamed. We paused the movie. We rewound the cheese pull.

      That memory stuck. Not just the flavor, but the feeling. The indulgence. The chaos. So I made my own. Not to copy Pizza Hut—but to crown myself cheese pull royalty. To build a crust that doesn’t just deliver—it dominates.

      This version starts with homemade dough, rolled thick and bold. Mozzarella sticks line the edges, tucked in and sealed like secrets. The sauce is tangy, the cheese is layered, and the toppings are whatever your heart screams for. It’s not just pizza—it’s a performance.

      I’ve served it at game nights, rooftop hangs, and post-show snack attacks. I’ve stuffed the crust with jalapeños, garlic butter, and even mac & cheese. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than delivery.”

      So here it is. Cheese Pull Royalty. A stuffed crust pizza reboot that owns the night. Slice it hot. Stretch it proud. And don’t forget to film the pull—it’s mandatory.
