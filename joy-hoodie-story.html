      <h2>üïØÔ∏è The Story</h2>
      <p>
        I wore this hoodie the day my sister came home from the hospital. It was oversized, fleeced, and smelled faintly of cedar and cinnamon from the candle I‚Äôd packed in my overnight bag. She said it looked like something you‚Äôd wear to a memory. I said that‚Äôs exactly what it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        The JOY Hoodie is for those moments when warmth needs to be more than temperature. It‚Äôs for the quiet walks, the loud reunions, the days you need to feel held. It‚Äôs stitched with softness and story.
