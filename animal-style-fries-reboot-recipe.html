    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Animal Style Fries were my first taste of snack rebellion. I remember devouring a tray after a midnight drive, cheese melting, onions caramelized, sauce dripping like drama. It was messy, melty, and iconic. Like a food fight you actually wanted to win.

      But the chain version started to feel soggy. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to misbehave. To build fries that crunch louder, melt harder, and refuse to be polite.

      This version starts with crispy shoestring fries, topped with caramelized onions, melted American cheese, and a homemade “animal sauce” that slaps. It’s not just a side—it’s a spectacle. You can layer it, drown it, or eat it straight from the tray. I won’t judge.

      I’ve served it at rooftop hangs, post-rant snack attacks, and chaotic brunch spreads. I’ve added jalapeños, swapped cheese blends, and even turned it into nacho fries. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than In-N-Out.”

      So here it is. Messy, Melty, Iconic. An Animal Style Fries reboot that refuses to behave. Serve it hot. Eat it loud. And don’t forget the napkins—this snack gets emotional.
