    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Domino’s cheesy bread was my first taste of edible theater. I remember pulling apart a piece at a sleepover, cheese stretching like a spotlight moment, garlic butter glistening like stage makeup. We clapped. We cheered. We devoured.

      But the delivery version started to feel flat. Too greasy, not enough flair. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to dramatize. To build a cheesy bread that melts hearts, breaks rules, and earns applause.

      This version starts with a soft, herbed dough brushed with garlic butter. It’s stuffed and topped with a blend of mozzarella, provolone, and cheddar. Baked until golden, then sliced for maximum pull-apart drama. It’s not just bread—it’s a performance.

      I’ve served it at game nights, rooftop hangs, and post-show snack attacks. I’ve stuffed it with jalapeños, layered it with pesto, and even turned it into brunch boats. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Domino’s.”

      So here it is. Pull-Apart Drama. A cheesy bread reboot that deserves a standing ovation. Serve it hot. Stretch it proud. And don’t forget the dip—it’s part of the encore.
