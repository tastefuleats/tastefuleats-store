    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Sonic’s Cherry Limeade was my first taste of liquid attitude. I remember sipping one in the backseat of a summer road trip, windows down, lip gloss poppin’, and zero emotional baggage. It was sweet, tart, and gloriously unbothered. Like a pool party in a cup.

      But the chain version started to feel flat. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to sting. To build a limeade that sips like summer and slaps like sass.

      This version starts with fresh lime juice, cherry syrup, and fizzy lemon-lime soda. Add crushed ice, maraschino cherries, and lime wheels for drama. It’s not just a drink—it’s a vibe. You can spike it, freeze it, or pour it into glitter cups. I won’t judge.

      I’ve served it at rooftop hangs, post-rant snack attacks, and chaotic brunch spreads. I’ve turned it into popsicles, slushies, and even cocktail mixers. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Sonic.”

      So here it is. Sweet, Tart, Unbothered. A Cherry Limeade reboot that sips like summer and stings like sass. Serve it cold. Garnish it loud. And don’t forget the straw—this drink deserves a spotlight.
