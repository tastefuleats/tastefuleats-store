    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      The Italian BMT was my first taste of sandwich rebellion. I remember ordering one after skipping class, extra pickles, extra sass, no regrets. It was salty, stacked, and somehow felt like a middle finger wrapped in deli paper.

      But the chain version started to feel tame. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to clap back. To build a sandwich that talks louder, tastes better, and doesn’t apologize for being extra.

      This version starts with a crusty ciabatta roll, layered with spicy salami, smoky ham, and pepperoni that bites back. Then comes provolone, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, banana peppers, and a drizzle of zesty vinaigrette. It’s not just a sub—it’s a manifesto.

      I’ve served it at rooftop hangs, post-rant snack attacks, and chaotic kitchen dance parties. I’ve swapped meats, added jalapeños, and even turned it into a panini. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Subway.”

      So here it is. Stacked, Salty, Unfiltered. An Italian BMT reboot that talks back and tastes better. Slice it bold. Serve it loud. And don’t forget the napkins—this sandwich has opinions.
