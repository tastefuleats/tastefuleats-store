    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza Hut’s stuffed crust was my first taste of edible rebellion. I remember biting into the edge and realizing the crust wasn’t the end—it was the encore. Cheese oozing, sauce dripping, and zero regrets. It was extra, dramatic, and unapologetically bold.

      But the chain version started to feel tired. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to elevate. To build a crust that bites back, steals the show, and makes the center jealous.

      This version starts with a herbed dough, rolled wide and wrapped around mozzarella sticks or string cheese. The base gets sauced, topped, and baked until golden. The crust? It’s gooey, crispy, and engineered for drama. You can dip it, twist it, or just eat the edges first. I won’t judge.

      I’ve served it at rooftop hangs, post-rant snack attacks, and chaotic pizza parties. I’ve stuffed it with jalapeños, pesto, and even hot honey. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Pizza Hut.”

      So here it is. Extra, Edgy, Stuffed. A crust reboot that bites back and steals the show. Slice it bold. Serve it loud. And don’t forget the dip—this crust demands attention.
