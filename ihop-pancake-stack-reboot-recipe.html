    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      IHOP pancakes were my first taste of edible excess. I remember ordering a stack taller than my emotional stability, drowning in syrup, whipped cream, and questionable decisions. It was fluffy, sweet, and gloriously uncivilized. Like dessert disguised as breakfast.

      But the chain version started to feel flat. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to flip the script. To build a stack that rises with drama, drips with intention, and slaps with flavor.

      This version starts with a buttermilk batter that’s thick, tangy, and ready to rise. Each pancake is golden, fluffy, and slightly crisp at the edges. Then comes the syrup—maple, berry, or chaos blend. Top it with whipped cream, fresh fruit, and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. It’s not just breakfast—it’s a brunch riot.

      I’ve served it at rooftop brunches, post-rave breakfasts, and chaotic kitchen dance parties. I’ve layered it with Nutella, stuffed it with cream cheese, and even turned it into pancake tacos. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than IHOP.”

      So here it is. Fluffy, Syrupy, Uncivilized. A pancake stack reboot that flips the script. Stack it high. Drip it proud. And don’t forget the fork—this stack demands respect.
