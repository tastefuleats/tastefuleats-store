    <h2>Fluffy, Syrupy, Uncivilized</h2>
    <p class="byline">Written by Bryan Stewart</p>
    <p>
      IHOP was my first chapel of edible excess. I remember a late-night stack that towered like bad decisions—whipped cream listing to one side, syrup pooling like regret, butter melting into a golden mess that didn’t apologize to anyone. It was dessert in breakfast drag, joy without restraint, a sugar sermon in a paper menu cathedral. If you’ve never been young, sleep-deprived, and convinced sweetness might save your life, you haven’t truly met pancakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chain version eventually turned predictable, like a song you loved too many times. I kept ordering the same memory, hoping it would hit the same way, but nostalgia has a shelf life when it’s reheated. So I made my own—not to copy, but to flip. Not to tidy, but to testify. Pancakes had to be more than polite circles on a plate. They had to rise and drip and collapse and redeem. They had to carry the unspoken stuff: breakups, breakthroughs, hunger that wasn’t just about food.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first attempt was a disaster. I mixed the batter until it was smooth as a lie, ignoring the lumps that are actually small promises of fluff. I rushed the rest, poured too soon. The pan screamed. Butter burned. My flip hesitated, then failed—half-cooked centers like wet confessions, edges charred with shame. The stack leaned and then fell, a messy high-rise without permits. I ate two bites and fed the rest to the trash. It tasted like impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure became a teacher I didn’t ask for. I learned that buttermilk is a mood, not a measurement. That batter needs to sit—ten minutes at least—so the flour can think and the leavening can plan its uprising. I learned that the pan deserves ceremony: medium heat, butter blooming, a test drop that sizzles gentle like gossip, not screeches like panic. I learned the flip is a commitment—decisive, swift, no second guessing—because pancakes smell fear and respond with collapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Success arrived in fragments. The first proud edge that crisped in butter. The first surface that bubbled like a newsfeed, tiny domes rising and popping. The first flip that landed with a soft thwap and stayed. The first stack that stood taller than my appetite, so golden it felt like a morning I hadn’t earned. Syrup ribboned down the sides in slow motion. Powdered sugar snowed like new hope. For a minute, the kitchen went quiet—the kind of silence that feels like reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we build in the pan is architecture. Soft center, sturdy edge, a geometry of heat and patience. And like every building, pancakes carry the life that happens inside them. I’ve cooked stacks for friends who needed the sweetness of being seen, for collaborators who survived a hard week, for myself when the only thing to do was flip something and watch steam rise. Sometimes the batter was too thick and needed breath. Sometimes the heat was wrong and forgave me anyway. The ritual mattered more than perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love the chaos. The syrup flood that drowns the bottom pancake in sticky drama. The butter that streaks across the skillet like a comet, leaving kissed edges behind. The berry compote that stains your shirt and your morning. The fork scrape, the soft sigh, the laugh when a pancake rips as you lift it and you pretend it was intentional. We talk about pancakes as comfort, but they’re also confession—sweetness for the part of you that doesn’t want to explain. You bite, you remember, you let the sugar make space for the words you don’t have yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contributor pride shows up in the details. One friend swears by a tablespoon of peanut butter whisked into the batter—says it’s a hug disguised as protein. Another adds lemon zest, insists that pancakes should flirt with brightness. A third, the chaos engineer, folds in mini chocolate chips and crushed espresso beans, calling it “brunch for people who aren’t afraid of speed.” I tried all of it. Some batches sang. Some spiraled. All of them felt like community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure keeps coming back like a relative with strong opinions. I’ve burned the second one in a stack because I got cocky. I’ve undercooked the center because I chased color over doneness. I’ve let the batter sit too long, watched it thicken into stubbornness, added milk, diluted the soul. I’ve flipped too early, flipped too late, flipped like a coward. The plate doesn’t lie. Neither does the mouth. You taste your choices, and you learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Success, though—success is a quiet flex. It’s the clean flip and the hiss settling into steam. It’s the edge that shatters softly under the fork. It’s the inside that springs back like it remembers the shape it was born to be. It’s maple syrup that’s warm but not boiling—the kind that kisses, not scalds. It’s the whipped cream that slouches artfully, the berries that stain the rim, the powdered sugar that makes the plate look like a snow globe you shook gently. It’s friends reaching in, forks crossing, someone saying, “Dude. This is better than IHOP,” and you believe them because you were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The millennial glossary is all over this stack: thrifted plates, rooftop brunches, playlists that start hopeful and end loud, late mornings that demand a reason to stand up. These pancakes have a playlist too—songs that make the flip feel like choreography, tracks that turn the syrup pour into a slow-motion video in your head. If you don’t think food can score your day, you haven’t drizzled syrup while the chorus hits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s the ritual I keep: whisk dry in one bowl—flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt. Wet in another—buttermilk, eggs, melted butter that cooled its temper. Fold, don’t scold. Let the batter sit. Pan at medium. Butter in, swirl, breathe. Ladle batter, watch bubbles set the roadmap. Flip once. Don’t stack too hot—give them air. Plate with intention—maple first, then cream or fruit, sugar like farewell snow. Eat without apologies. If they collapse, call it art. If they rise like saints, let them have the sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone asked me why pancakes matter, and I told them the truth: because they are simple enough to fail and forgiving enough to try again. Because they taste like childhood without pretending you’re still there. Because they let you be dramatic in the morning when drama feels medicinal. Because they are the kind of food you can make for someone without needing any other words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best bite is never the first—it’s the one you take after laughing. After someone steals a forkful and you pretend to be mad. After syrup brushes your hand and you lick it without ceremony. After the stack sighs a little into the plate and you remember you might be okay. Food is memory architecture. Pancakes are a corner room with soft light and a couch you don’t need permission to collapse into.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fail hard. Succeed softly. Flip anyway. These pancakes don’t ask you to be perfect. They ask you to show up. That’s their secret, and maybe mine too. If you need a recipe, I’ve got you. If you need a ritual, I’ve got more. And if you need to feel something sweet that still respects your chaos, put butter in a hot pan and let the morning happen.
