    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna was my first taste of edible grief. I remember making it after a breakup, layering noodles like emotional bandages, stirring sauce like a ritual. It was messy, saucy, and unapologetically comforting. Like therapy, but with garlic.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the traditional version started to feel heavy. So I made my own. Not to copy—but to heal. To build a vegan lasagna that holds grief and garlic. That layers flavor with intention and comfort with clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This version starts with a homemade Beyond-style ground—mushrooms, lentils, walnuts, and umami seasoning. Then comes the marinara, simmered with garlic and emotional depth. Then the cashew béchamel—creamy, nutty, and built to soothe. We layer it all between no-boil noodles and roast it until bubbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve served it at rooftop hangs, post-therapy snack rituals, and chaotic brunch spreads. I’ve added spinach, swapped sauces, and even turned it into lasagna rolls. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than real lasagna.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So here it is. Layered, Saucy, Uncompromising. A vegan lasagna reboot that holds grief and garlic. Serve it hot. Eat it slow. And don’t forget the napkins—this dish gets emotional.
    </p>

    <h2>The Flavor Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      This lasagna is built on emotional architecture. The ground is savory and textured. The béchamel is soft and soothing. The marinara is bold and forgiving. Each layer is a mood. Each bite is a memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      We tested the ground across dozens of batches—balancing mushrooms, lentils, walnuts, soy sauce, and smoked paprika. We wanted something that felt meaty without mimicry. Something that honored the original but stood on its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The béchamel is cashew-based, blended with garlic, lemon, and nutritional yeast. It’s creamy, tangy, and emotionally fluent. It doesn’t try to be cheese—it tries to be comfort.
    </p>

    <h2>Contributor Commentary</h2>
    <p>
      One contributor told us they make this lasagna after every hard conversation. Another swears by adding roasted eggplant and calling it “layered resilience.” One uses oat milk instead of almond. One adds chili flakes and calls it “rage sauce.” One eats it cold from the fridge with zero shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lasagna isn’t just food. It’s a ritual. A release. A reminder that flavor can be healing.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Recipe Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Because comfort should be inclusive. Because flavor should be intentional. Because grief deserves garlic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reboot is for the ones who layer with love. Who stir with memory. Who eat with their whole heart. It’s for the ones who believe that food should feel like a sanctuary—warm, messy, and unapologetically personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s not just lasagna. It’s a mood board. A manifesto. A mouthful of healing.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Notes From the Oven</h2>
    <p>
      You don’t need dairy to make this. You need depth, devotion, and a refusal to compromise. You need a sauce that simmers, a béchamel that soothes, and a ground that holds space. You need to trust your taste buds and honor your grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      So layer it proud. Bake it slow. Serve it warm. And don’t forget the napkins—this lasagna comes with feelings.
