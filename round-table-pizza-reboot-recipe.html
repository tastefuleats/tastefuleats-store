    <h2>The Story Behind the Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Round Table pizza was my childhood throne. I remember birthday parties with paper crowns, soda spills, and slices stacked like treasure. The crust was golden, the toppings were wild, and the vibe was pure medieval chaos. It wasn’t just pizza—it was a quest.

      Years later, I wanted that same energy—but with better ingredients and festival flair. I wanted a pizza that ruled the table, slayed the cravings, and made every bite feel like a coronation. So I built this reboot.

      It starts with a herbed dough—garlic, oregano, and olive oil. The sauce is bold and tangy. The cheese? A three-blend mix that melts like magic. The toppings? Whatever your inner monarch demands. I go with pepperoni, mushrooms, red onions, and jalapeños. But you can build your own kingdom.

      I’ve served this pizza at game nights, rooftop hangs, and post-show snack attacks. I’ve made it heart-shaped, spiral-stuffed, and even grilled. Every time, it hits. Every time, someone says, “This is better than Round Table.”

      So here it is. Legendary Crust, Royal Flavor. A pizza reboot that rules the realm. Slice it hot. Serve it proud. And don’t forget the crown—this pizza deserves one.
